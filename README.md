# Gradebook Management System

A Java-based application for managing student information and grades. This project was developed as part of a university final project and includes features for adding, searching, modifying, and removing student data, along with GPA visualization.

## Features
- **Student Management**: Input, search, modify, and remove student records.
- **GPA Visualization**: Display GPA distribution with a pie chart.
- **Data Display**: View student data in a table format for easy review.
- **File Saving**: Save student data to a text file for persistence.

## Note
Unfortunately, this program was developed as a final project for a university course in Korea, so it only supports the Korean language. However, you are welcome to explore the code to understand the implementation and logic.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the `Gradebook.jar` file in your IDE or terminal.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement data loading from saved files.
- Add sorting and filtering options for students and grades.
